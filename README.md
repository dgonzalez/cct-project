# Cloud Based Web Technolgies

This is the repository for CCT Cloud Based Web Technologies Project.

There are two sub-folders:
- [node](/node): The node.js project (Using npm as build system)
- [java](/java-spring): The Java project (Using gradle as build system)

Just choose one technology (no need to do both). The project is
